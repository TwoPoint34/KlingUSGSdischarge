This is the readme for a sample program written in R for discharge/streamflow in the Allen Creek watershed in Ann Arbor, Michigan. USGS data for site 04174490 is used starting from 2020-01-01 and ending 2021-01-01. The program saves the summary statistics and regression equation as the following files in the working directory: linear_model_summary, time_series_plot, trend_plot. This script was created with assistance from ChatGPT and in collaboration between TwoPoint34 and AGgeoviz. TwoPoint34 authored the original script while AGgeoviz created a branch for saving the script outputs locally. TwoPoint34 then added the additional branch to the main branch.
